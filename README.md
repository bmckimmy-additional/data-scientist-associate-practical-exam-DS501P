# Practical Exam: House sales

RealAgents is a real estate company that focuses on selling houses.

RealAgents sells a variety of types of house in one metropolitan area.

Some houses sell slowly and sometimes require lowering the price in order to find a buyer.

In order to stay competitive, RealAgents would like to optimize the listing prices of the houses it is trying to sell.

They want to do this by predicting the sale price of a house given its characteristics.

If they can predict the sale price in advance, they can decrease the time to sale.

## Data

The dataset contains records of previous houses sold in the area.
